<p><strong>Iceshrimp</strong> is a decentralized and federated social networking service, implementing the <strong>ActivityPub</strong> standard.<br>
This repository contains our efforts to continue the Iceshrimp project's legacy - in the form of an entirely new codebase, with a focus on performance, stability and maintainability.</p>

> **Note**
> This is beta software. While the Mastodon client API is relatively complete, the frontend is not. It is therefore not advisable to upgrade existing Iceshrimp instances at present. Setting up staging instances to help us with testing is very appreciated, however, and will help us ensure eventual upgrades go as smoothly as possible.
>
> If everything goes well, we estimate that there'll be a stable release by the end of 2024.
