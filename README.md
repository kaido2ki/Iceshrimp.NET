<p><strong>Iceshrimp</strong> is a decentralized and federated social networking service, implementing the <strong>ActivityPub</strong> standard.<br>
This repository contains our efforts to rewrite both the backend and the frontend, to improve performance, stability and maintainability.</p>

Want to donate to the project?
  - Our backend lead dev (zotan) is in need of a better laptop, as their current one does not have enough memory. You can contribute [here](https://bunq.me/zotanlaptopcrowdfund). Any leftover money will be given to queers in need.

> **Note**
> This is alpha software. While the Mastodon client API is relatively complete, the frontend is not. It is therefore not advisable to upgrade existing Iceshrimp instances at present. Setting up staging instances to help us with testing is very appreciated, however, and will help us ensure eventual upgrades go as smoothly as possible.
