  - Strong focus on maintainability, stability & performance, as well as user choice and configurability
  - Prioritization bug fixes over features
- Project anti-goals:
  - Flashy marketing
  - Commercialization of any kind

> **Note**
> This is beta software. The Mastodon client API is relatively complete, the frontend is rapidly improving. Nonetheless, we don't recommend to upgrade existing Iceshrimp-JS instances quite yet. Setting up new instances and reporting bugs is very appreciated, however, and will help us ensure eventual upgrades go as smoothly as possible.
>
> If everything goes well, we estimate that there'll be a stable release by the end of 2024.
