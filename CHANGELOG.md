## v2024.1-beta1
This is the first ever tagged release of Iceshrimp.NET, the successor to iceshrimp-js. While it is performant and stable, many features are still incomplete. Check the [README](README.md) for more details.

### Release notes
We've been very hard at work over the past (*checks notes*) 8 months! This release is a very big milestone, as all the "core" features of an AP-compatible social network have been implemented. To us, this means that we now consider this software "beta". This means that we'll start to push tagged releases (somewhat) regularly again. We're aiming for a stable release (with feature-parity) by the end of 2024. We really hope you enjoy!

### Highlights
- All-new backend & frontend
- So many more more changes than we could possibly list here, explore for yourself!

### Attribution
This release was made possible by project contributors: Laura Hausmann, Lilian, Thomas May & pancakes
